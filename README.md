# AIME Bot

# Usage
Use this bot to fetch past American Invitational Mathematics Exam problems from 2022 to practice for the exam!

# How to use
To select a specific problem, you must type in its problem id. The id is formed by:

+ Getting the year of release(i.e 2022)
+ Getting the version of the test(AIME I/II)
+ Getting the problem number(i.e #13)

If one wants to find the the problem labeled 2022 AIME II Problem 7, then the id will simply be 202227. 2022 is the year of release, 2 is the version, and 7 is the problem number.

If one wants a random problem, simply type in `!random` and the bot will spew a randomly picked problem.

If one wants to check/find the answer to their problem, simply type in `!answer [problem id] [answer]`(with spaces) and the bot will reply by responding whether it is incorrect or correct.

More functions will be coming to this bot, like the addition of more problems and the `!test` command, which will give the user a 15-problem randomly generated test.
